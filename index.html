  <h1>Sam Alvarez — Building People, Systems & Competence</h1>
  <p>A synthesis of my 3 core pillars, supporting skills, and the emerging industries where I position myself for long-term value during the AI-driven economy.</p>

  <div class="section pillars">
    <h2>Core Pillars</h2>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>1. A2B Certified Coach</h3>
      <p>I help individuals and teams develop self-awareness through A2B hardwires, moving them from reactive to response‑able. Whether it's 1‑on‑1 coaching or team workshops, I use structured frameworks to create measurable growth and lasting behavioural change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>2. Event & Project Management</h3>
      <p>I create experiences teams remember. From logistics (transport, venue, sound) to facilitation (workshops, games, meaningful reflection), I handle the operational and experiential side so organisations can focus on their people—not the details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>3. Talent Spotter & Competence Builder</h3>
      <p>I identify competent, response‑able people often missed by traditional hiring. No CV gatekeeping. I assess aptitude, attitude, and hardwires, then connect organisations with talent that aligns with their culture and long‑term growth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>GreenBeacons: Train-the-Trainer Model</h2>
    <p>We equip emerging leaders and under‑resourced teams with digital skills, concise communication, and personal finance basics. Our online tutoring and facilitation development ensure that reports, Gmail usage, and monthly submissions are professional—and that leaders set the example in both competence and behaviour.</p>
    <p>Our mentors are A2B‑certified change agents trained in Occupational Intelligence, a proven methodology focused on practice, inner volition, and measurable skill‑building.</p>
    <p><strong>Target clients:</strong> NGOs, Municipalities, Community Programmes<br>
       <strong>Target participants:</strong> Under‑resourced individuals & emerging leaders</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Supporting Competencies</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Administration & Management:</strong> Actively developed through my work at DUCT, strengthening my operational, documentation, and systems‑building capabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Investment Skill:</strong> A personal but disciplined track record of portfolio growth via EasyEquities. While not a client‑facing service, it informs how I understand long‑term value, risk, and industry opportunities.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Where I Fit in the AI Economy</h2>
    <p>I position myself inside the high‑leverage human industries Daniel Priestley highlights—consulting, training, competence‑building, and operations. These fields grow in value as AI scales. I can also invest in external sectors (like Medicine or Technical Industries) that I may not operate in directly but can participate in financially.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Person of Influence Path</h2>
    <p>Through consistent writing (200+ blogs), coaching, and project leadership, I am building the <em>demand‑side</em> of my career: expertise, insight, and brand. Partnering with or becoming a Key Person of Influence allows me to amplify the reach and demand for the systems, teams, and programmes I help build.</p>
